This is my first project in java about library management.
Login class is the main class from there application is getting started.
Two buttons will be there one for admin and another for Librarian.
Clicking admin button it moves to admin login page and clicking Librarian button it moves to Librarian Login page.
In admin Login page we have to give username and password ,if it is correct it moves to admin section and if it is wrong it gives a pop up message showing "wrong username or password".
Similarly Librarian Login page involves name and password ,if it is correct it moves to Librarian login section and if it is wrong it gives a pop up message showing "name or password wrong".
